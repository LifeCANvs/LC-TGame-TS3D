OVERVIEW
--------
This is a work-in-progress first-person shooter. It uses terminal-based 3D
graphics.

BUILDING
--------
Run make in the project root. This does not account for updates to dependencies.
To update those, see DEPENDENCIES.

RUNNING
-------
Currently, to run a demo sort of thing, execute either ./ts3d columns or
./ts3d title-screen after running Make. To exit, press 'x'.

DATA
----
The data/ directory holds game data. The data is stored in a combination of JSON
and simpler custom formats. It is organized into sub-directories.

DEPENDENCIES
------------
The external/ folder holds dependencies to other projects, with source code and
such bundled here. There are currently two dependencies, both of which I myself
created. d3d/ is the 3D graphics library. json/ is the JSON parser.

To update the depencies from Github, run ./update-all from external/.

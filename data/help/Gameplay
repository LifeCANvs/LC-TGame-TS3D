Kill the  enemies before they  kill you.
Luckily,  they aren't  very smart.  They
will turn toward you at random intervals
and shoot at different random intervals.
They may happen to shoot many bullets in
quick  succession. Each  bullet will  do
significant damage to your health, shown
by the  green bar  at the bottom  of the
screen.  Your level  of reloadedness  is
the red bar at the bottom. When it fills
up,  you can  shoot them  back. You  can
also  shoot their  bullets to  intercept
them, if you aim well. Keep in mind that
the bullets travel  slowly. The speed of
your  bullets is  also  not affected  by
your speed,  which I think  makes things
easier.
